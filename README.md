# Ham radio test prep

A simple interactive front-end for [ARRL's technician class question pool](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools). I wrote this to help myself prepare for my license exam.

Apparently there's also the [official exam review site](http://arrlexamreview.appspot.com/) which offers one-question-per-page interactive reviewing, as well as practice exams (available in both interactive and printable form). You should definitely check that out. However, depending on your learning style, you may find my all-on-one-page version more productive.

## TODO

* Expose option to show/hide all answers.
* Click to mark question as done (put a check mark next to the title), and expose option to hide / show (either only titles for clicking, or entire questions) all these questions. The rationale here is that we may want to focus on the questions we found hard and/or got wrong previously.
* Persist state in cookies.
